Python Functions and Data Structures: Demonstrating `greet`, `lambda`, List Comprehensions, and `Counter`

This repository showcases examples of basic Python concepts, including:
- A **greet** function that returns a personalized greeting.
- A **lambda** function for performing simple addition.
- **List comprehensions** to transform data, such as doubling the values in a list.
- Demonstrating **tuples** with immutable data types, like a fruit list.
- Using the **Counter** class from the `collections` module to count and display the frequency of items in a list, with results sorted by frequency.

These examples provide a quick overview of how to define functions, utilize lambdas, manipulate lists, and handle data with Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries.
